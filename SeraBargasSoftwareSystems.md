# Assessing Software Systems
Software Systems is the next focus of the CISBA program. This area provides the tools and knowledge needed to turn analytic solutions into working applications. Through these courses, I learned not only how to write code in languages such as Python, SQL, and HTML/CSS, but also how to design software systems with a solid architectural foundation. Gaining these skills is essential, as they bridge the gap between conceptual analysis and practical implementation, allowing ideas to be developed into real, usable solutions.
## Strengths
**Technical Foundations of CIS - 6303**

I was the strongest and most confident in learning HTML/CSS in this course. In my current role, I design and build websites with HTML and CSS, so I already had over nine years of experience applying these skills before taking this class. With this foundation of knowledge, I didnâ€™t need to dedicate extra time to learning these items, and I was able to complete the assignments with ease. SQL was another strength, as its syntax is straightforward and intuitive. Since I was taking this course alongside Data Management, I benefited from repeated exposure to SQL, which reinforced my understanding. Another strength I demonstrated in this course was time management. With only one official due date, it was important to plan and pace my work effectively. Knowing that Python was less familiar to me, I dedicated extra time and focus to learning the basics, ensuring I could build confidence with the language.

Understanding domain models conceptually and knowing how code should be structured was one of my strengths in this class. The explanations and instruction in Architecture Patterns with Python were clear and approachable, giving me a solid foundation for planning and building my own software prototype. My final project, which demonstrates this process, is located in this repo: [https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM6330-Final-Project.git](https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM6330-Final-Project.git). Another assignment involved creating domain diagrams such as activity, class, sequence, state machine, and use case. I found these diagrams straightforward to interpret and produce, so they did not require extensive additional research.
## Weaknesses
**Technical Foundations of CIS - 6303**

Writing Python code was the weakest area for me in this course. Since I had never used it before, expressing solutions in code required much more research and trial-and-error on my part. Looking back, I should have dedicated more time to exploring the language itself and practicing outside of class assignments. My project assignments are available in the following repositories: [https://github.com/wtamucis/assignment-python-chapter-3-hillsera](https://github.com/wtamucis/assignment-python-chapter-3-hillsera), [https://github.com/wtamucis/assignment-python-chapter-6-hillsera](https://github.com/wtamucis/assignment-python-chapter-6-hillsera), and [https://github.com/wtamucis/assignment-python-chapter-12-hillsera](https://github.com/wtamucis/assignment-python-chapter-12-hillsera). While I now understand the basics of Python syntax and structure, generating my own solutions and knowing what questions to research still takes me longer than with other programming languages.

**Software Engineering and Systems Development - 6330**

I had never worked with a back-end web framework before, so using Django in this course was a significant weakness for me. Its syntax and structure were quite different from what I was accustomed to, which added to the learning curve. Another challenge was adapting to test-driven development. In my professional work, this method is not commonly used, so it required me to reframe my mindset to think about testing as I built the application. This project demonstrates these tests in action: [https://github.com/hillsera/roman_numerals_kata](https://github.com/hillsera/roman_numerals_kata). Keeping a test-driven environment in mind is an area I will need to continue practicing and strengthening.
## What I wish I Knew
As mentioned in the previous assessment, my weakest area is still working with Python. Strengthening this skill will be essential for me to feel fully confident when creating the final project for this course. In addition, adopting a test-driven development mindset would allow me to identify and resolve problems earlier in the process, rather than discovering issues only at the end. Building a stronger foundation in Python and practicing TDD now will not only boost my confidence for the capstone but also prepare me for future professional projects that require more advanced coding practices.
## Capabilities and Preparedness Summary 
This area is the one I feel least confident compared to the other three areas of focus within the program. I know I will have to dedicate more time in actually building out my final project versus planning the structure. I do have a strong conceptual foundation in which to build upon at least, so I can be sure that from the beginning my project will be of a sound design. 
## Integration With Other Areas
Software Systems integrates with the other program areas by acting as the layer that transforms conceptual ideas and analyses into practical, usable tools. While Data Management provides the structured storage and access to information, and Data Analytics produces insights from that data, Software Systems packages these outputs into applications that people can interact with directly. Networking and Cybersecurity ensure these applications remain accessible, reliable, and secure. Without this integration, the value of the analyses would remain theoretical rather than actionable. To me, this area serves as the tangible interface for end users, while the other areas provide the behind-the-scenes foundation. Together, they ensure that solutions are not only well-designed but also functional, secure, and impactful.
## Final Thoughts
This area of the program will require focused effort to effectively build out my project, but I now have a clear understanding of where to concentrate my time and energy. While it represents my biggest challenge, it also offers the most potential for creativity and problem-solving which are two aspects I enjoy. By dedicating time to strengthen my Python skills, and practice test-driven development, I am confident I can turn this challenge into a rewarding and successful component of my capstone project.
