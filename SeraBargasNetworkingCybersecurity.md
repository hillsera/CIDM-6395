# Assessing Networking and Cybersecurity
The final area of focus for the CISBA program is Networking and Cybersecurity. I really enjoyed both courses, as they helped round out my understanding of how to create secure systems and recognize potential vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity. Gaining knowledge in this area is essential for building software solutions that not only function effectively but also operate within safe, protected environments. These skills ensure that applications and data remain resilient against malicious threats, completing the foundation necessary to design and manage secure systems.
## Strengths
**Current Issues in Cybersecurity - 6341**

As with any skill, consistent practice makes it easier to develop and retain. Recognizing phishing attempts through fraudulent websites or emails came naturally to me, as my workplace regularly conducts phishing simulations for cybersecurity awareness. Another strength was assessing my personal attack surface and creating a contingency plan in case of a security breach. While these assignments focused on personal devices and vulnerabilities, the knowledge is directly transferable to my professional life as well. Some of these assignments can be found in this repository: [https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6341.git](https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6341.git). 

**Digital Forensics and Fraud Detection - 6356**

One of the main assignments in this class was to create a fraud detection application. My strongest area for this project was designing an effective user interface, as I have the most experience in this area. The files for this project can be found here: [https://github.com/wtamucis/fraud-detection-website-hillsera.git](https://github.com/wtamucis/fraud-detection-website-hillsera.git). Another strength was using SQL to perform queries to determine whether fraud was being committed by company employees. Because I had already completed several courses involving SQL, and because of its straightforward syntax, I was able to complete these queries with ease and minimal additional research.
## Weaknesses
**Current Issues in Cybersecurity - 6341**

Although this course did not require coding, it involved writing reports and completing activities to demonstrate cybersecurity concepts in practice. One of my biggest challenges was explaining my processes and findings thoroughly enough. This skill is critical so that others who were not present during the activities can still understand and trust the results or solutions presented. A recurring theme in my weaknesses for this course was the need to provide more detailed explanations and analyses. For example, the Shields Up report located here, [https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6341/blob/main/SeraHill-ShieldsUp.pdf](https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6341/blob/main/SeraHill-ShieldsUp.pdf), received my lowest grade of the semester. Moving forward, I plan to focus on improving the clarity and depth of my explanations to ensure that others can easily follow my reasoning and approach in future projects.

A recurring theme across my weaknesses throughout this program is my lack of confidence with the Python language. While I am comfortable reading and understanding what a Python script does, I am not yet confident in writing my own. This limitation also affected my ability to develop effective machine learning models using Python and pandas. However, since I understand the fundamentals, I have a solid foundation on which to build further skills. Another weakness in this course was not dedicating enough time to deeply explore and practice Python beyond the course requirements.
## What I wish I Knew
As mentioned in the previous assessments, the area in which I am weakest is Python and developing my own machine learning or fraud detection algorithms. While I have a strong enough foundation to know what questions to research, I do not yet feel confident creating algorithms independently. Continued practice and developing my own projects will help strengthen my skills and build confidence in this area.
## Capabilities and Preparedness Summary 
I feel confident in the conceptual knowledge I have developed through these courses. I have a strong foundation on which to build my final project, though some areas will require additional time and effort, particularly learning to write machine learning algorithms and more efficient Python code. Overall, this foundation gives me confidence in my ability to successfully complete my final project. 
## Integration With Other Areas
Networking and cybersecurity act as the protective layer surrounding any software solution. Ensuring that applications are secure helps prevent unauthorized access and protects sensitive data from exploitation. Detecting and mitigating fraudulent behavior early is essential to prevent malicious activity from compromising the entire system. In data analytics projects, safeguarding customer and user data is critical as data breaches can quickly erode trust between a company and its users. Cybersecurity ensures the integrity of the data being collected, stored, and analyzed. Without proper security measures, the reliability of the entire system can be compromised, potentially leading to severe organizational consequences. Cybersecurity practices should be integrated throughout the development process, not treated as an afterthought. Python can be a valuable tool in implementing these practices during the build phase, reinforcing security as a fundamental part of every stage of development.
## Final Thoughts
Conceptually, I have a strong foundation on which to build my final project. I feel confident in my ability to plan and design a secure application that protects data and users effectively. With additional time and focus on researching proper coding methods and security best practices, I can ensure my project is developed with both integrity and resilience in mind. I know where to direct my efforts for the greatest improvement, and Iâ€™m prepared to apply my knowledge toward creating a thoughtful and secure final solution.
