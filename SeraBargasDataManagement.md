# Assessing Data Management
The next section for the CISBA program focuses on Data Management. This area is crucial to any business, regardless of focus. Even if a company is not actively analyzing collected customer data, it still must be stored securely and made accessible when needed. The knowledge and skills learned in Data and Information Management (6350), and Data Mining Methods (6355), has set me up with a solid foundation for how to store data and how to access that stored data. I also recognize areas where I need further study and practice like knowing what the correct join type is needed, creating database diagrams, etc.
## Strengths
**Data and Information Management - 6350**

I found SQL to be a fairly straightforward language to learn. The syntax was very simple, and the terms used to filter or group information by were clear. Writing basic queries quickly became one of my strongest areas in this class. Most of the practice in these areas were done in Datacamp, but I do have some work examples to show. The assignments I have added to this repo show some simple queries used in the class: [https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6350.git](https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6350.git). Knowing how to connect data tables together in a database was another strength of mine in this class. When analyzing database schemas and diagrams, I found it intuitive to identify how tables should be connected and on which keys, specifically at the visual database design level. I will go further into my struggles with doing this in SQL itself in the weaknesses section of this document. 

**Data Mining Methods - 6355**

Compared to the database class, Data Mining was far more engaging and interesting. I found preparing and accessing data with RapidMiner Studio to be both intuitive and enjoyable. A strength from this class was interpreting the results I got from different models. The UI in RapidMiner Studio allowed me to focus on the data output itself instead of struggling with how to write code to generate what was needed anyway. Some of the processes used are in this repo: [https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6355.git](https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6355.git). Another strength was reading a business problem, and identifying what variables were relevant to the analysis. Distinguishing when to use supervised versus unsupervised learning models came naturally to me. These strengths made it easier for me to connect data mining concepts to real business problems and to see how predictive insights could guide business decisions.
## Weaknesses
**Data and Information Management - 6350**

While understanding database design visually became a strength of mine, creating a diagram from scratch is an area where I struggled. The “Assignment 5” document in this repo: [https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6350.git](https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6350.git) shows several database diagrams involving many-to-many and many-to-one relationships. Knowing how to read database designs should be sufficient for my intended career path in data/business analytics, but additional practice would still strengthen my understanding. Another area I struggled with was knowing what type of join to use like inner, left, or right. Again, I just need to spend more time practicing these concepts using SQL to gain confidence. We briefly used Pandas and PySpark in this course, but the exposure was too limited for me to build any confidence in them, especially since this was one of the first courses I took in the program.

**Data Mining Methods - 6355**

While we used the simple interface of RapidMiner Studio, we also did some projects in R. R felt very different from the other languages I had learned, making it harder to pick up. The homework assignments in this repo: [https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6355.git](https://github.com/hillsera/CIDM-6355.git) show screenshots of analyses done in R, but I am not yet confident in writing R code independently. Regarding specific learning models, neural networks were something I struggled with as well. I found them less intuitive than decision trees because they require larger datasets, more parameter tuning, and were harder to interpret in general. Also, while I understood most of the models discussed in class and how to use them, I had trouble with knowing which ones were best in certain situations. I often needed extra time to decide which model to use, but with additional practice and application, I am confident I can strengthen this skill.
## What I wish I Knew
The area I would like to improve the most in is my ability to understand machine learning models at a deeper level and apply them effectively to business problems. Strengthening this knowledge would allow me to select the most appropriate model for a given situation, explain my choices with confidence, and translate results into actionable insights. Whether implemented through Python, RapidMiner Studio, or other tools, the underlying conceptual knowledge will remain essential. The courses in this section provided me with a strong foundation, and I plan to build on it through additional practice, tutorials, and applied projects to gain confidence in both model selection and interpretation.
## Capabilities and Preparedness Summary 
Overall, I feel confident in my ability to apply Data Management concepts to my capstone project. I have the knowledge and tools to work with databases, manage data effectively, and draw insights, but I also recognize that this area may require more involved preparation than others. I will need to allow for more time to prepare this area of the project. However, with focused effort and continued practice, I am prepared to meet these challenges and build a strong foundation for my project.
## Integration With Other Areas
Data Management serves as the foundation for the other areas of this program. Before meaningful analysis can take place, data must be stored securely, organized effectively, and made accessible. Once this groundwork is complete, Data Analytics can build upon it to extract insights and forecast trends. Likewise, Software Systems provide the tools and applications that interact with databases, while Networking and Cybersecurity ensure that the stored information remains protected and reliable. Together, these areas form a cohesive process where Data Management is the essential first step.
## Final Thoughts
While Data Management may not yet be my strongest area, I have built a solid foundation to support my capstone project. My understanding of database design and data mining equips me to set up and access the data needed for meaningful analysis. With continued practice in SQL and deeper study of machine learning models, I am confident that I can expand these skills to meet the demands of a successful project.
